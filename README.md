How pointless can you get?


## How to play?
It's pretty self-explanatory. If you can't figure it out, you obviously don't speak English, which means you're not reading this, which means that you don't know that it's self-explanatory, but even if you did, you wouldn't know English, so... (this goes on and on)

## How is it pointless?
Because you're never right. It's impossible. (Well, there *is* ONE way to win, but that involves a Git utensil called a "fork")
